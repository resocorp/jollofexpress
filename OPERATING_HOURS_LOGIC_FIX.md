# Operating Hours Logic - Fixed ✅

## Issue Identified

**Date**: October 23, 2025 (Thursday)  
**Reported By**: User  
**Problem**: Restaurant showed "Open" on customer menu despite Thursday being marked as "Closed" in operating hours

---

## Root Cause

The customer-facing status was showing **ONLY** the manual toggle (`is_open` flag) without considering operating hours. This created a confusing situation:

❌ **Before Fix**:
- Admin sets Thursday as "Closed" in operating hours
- Manual toggle in Kitchen Controls is ON
- Customer sees: **"Open"** 🟢 (WRONG!)
- Customer tries to order: **Rejected** (because of operating hours check)

**Result**: Confusing UX - banner says "Open" but orders are rejected

---

## Correct Logic

Restaurant should be **effectively OPEN** only when **BOTH** conditions are met:

```
Effective Status = Operating Hours ✅ AND Manual Toggle ✅
```

### Truth Table

| Operating Hours | Manual Toggle | Effective Status | Why |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|-----|
| ✅ Open         | ✅ ON          | 🟢 **OPEN**      | Both conditions met |
| ✅ Open         | ❌ OFF         | 🔴 **CLOSED**    | Manually closed by staff |
| ❌ Closed       | ✅ ON          | 🔴 **CLOSED**    | Outside operating hours |
| ❌ Closed       | ❌ OFF         | 🔴 **CLOSED**    | Both conditions prevent opening |

---

## Implementation

### 1. Updated Status API (`app/api/restaurant/status/route.ts`)

**Before** (WRONG):
```typescript
return {
  is_open: settings.is_open,  // Only manual toggle
  ...
}
```

**After** (CORRECT):
```typescript
const manuallyOpen = settings.is_open;
const withinOperatingHours = hoursCheck.shouldBeOpen;
const effectivelyOpen = withinOperatingHours && manuallyOpen; // ✅ Both checked

return {
  is_open: effectivelyOpen,  // Effective status
  manual_override: manuallyOpen,  // Show manual state separately
  within_hours: withinOperatingHours,  // Show hours status separately
  closed_reason: effectivelyOpen ? null : reason,  // Why closed
  ...
}
```

### 2. Response Structure

**New fields in `/api/restaurant/status`**:

```json
{
  "is_open": false,  // ← Effective status (operating hours AND manual toggle)
  "estimated_prep_time": 30,
  "message": "Currently closed - Closed today",
  "closed_reason": "Closed on Thursdays",  // ← NEW: Why closed
  "manual_override": true,  // ← NEW: Manual toggle state
  "within_hours": false,  // ← NEW: Operating hours status
  "hours": {
    "today": "Closed today",
    "all": { ... }
  },
  "next_status_change": null
}
```

### 3. Banner Display

**Updated to show reason**:
```tsx
{/* When closed */}
<div>
  <p>Currently closed - Closed today</p>
  <p>Reason: Closed on Thursdays</p>  {/* ← NEW */}
  <p>Today's Hours: Closed today</p>
</div>
```

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Closed Day (Thursday with manual toggle ON)

**Configuration**:
- Operating Hours: Thursday = Closed
- Manual Toggle: ON (Kitchen Controls)
- Current Day: Thursday

**Result**:
```json
{
  "is_open": false,  // ← Closed due to operating hours
  "closed_reason": "Closed on Thursdays",
  "manual_override": true,  // Toggle is ON but doesn't matter
  "within_hours": false,  // Outside operating hours
  "message": "Currently closed - Closed today"
}
```

**Customer Sees**:
```
🔴 Closed
Currently closed - Closed today
Reason: Closed on Thursdays
Today's Hours: Closed today
```

**Order Attempt**: ❌ Rejected with "Outside operating hours - Closed on Thursdays"

---

### Scenario 2: Within Hours but Manually Closed

**Configuration**:
- Operating Hours: Monday 9 AM - 9 PM
- Manual Toggle: OFF (Kitchen Controls)
- Current Time: Monday 2 PM

**Result**:
```json
{
  "is_open": false,  // ← Closed due to manual toggle
  "closed_reason": "Manually closed by staff",
  "manual_override": false,  // Toggle is OFF
  "within_hours": true,  // Within operating hours
  "message": "Currently closed. Please check back later"
}
```

**Customer Sees**:
```
🔴 Closed
Currently closed. Please check back later
Reason: Manually closed by staff
Today's Hours: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM
```

**Order Attempt**: ❌ Rejected with "Restaurant is currently closed"

---

### Scenario 3: Open (Both Conditions Met)

**Configuration**:
- Operating Hours: Monday 9 AM - 9 PM
- Manual Toggle: ON
- Current Time: Monday 2 PM

**Result**:
```json
{
  "is_open": true,  // ← Open (both conditions met)
  "closed_reason": null,
  "manual_override": true,
  "within_hours": true,
  "message": "Currently open and accepting orders. Closes at 9:00 PM"
}
```

**Customer Sees**:
```
🟢 Open  ⏰ 30 min
Last orders at 9:00 PM
```

**Order Attempt**: ✅ Accepted

---

### Scenario 4: Before Opening Time

**Configuration**:
- Operating Hours: Monday 9 AM - 9 PM
- Manual Toggle: ON
- Current Time: Monday 8 AM

**Result**:
```json
{
  "is_open": false,  // ← Closed (before opening time)
  "closed_reason": "Opens at 9:00 AM",
  "manual_override": true,
  "within_hours": false,  // Before opening time
  "message": "Currently closed. Opens at 9:00 AM"
}
```

**Customer Sees**:
```
🔴 Closed
Currently closed. Opens at 9:00 AM
Reason: Opens at 9:00 AM
Today's Hours: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM
Opens at 9:00 AM
```

**Order Attempt**: ❌ Rejected with "Outside operating hours - Opens at 9:00 AM"

---

## Order Creation Flow (Updated)

```
Customer attempts to place order
    ↓
CHECK 0: Operating Hours
    ├─ Outside hours? → ❌ REJECT (403)
    │   Example: "Outside operating hours - Closed on Thursdays"
    └─ Within hours? → Continue
    ↓
CHECK 1: Manual Status
    ├─ Manual toggle OFF? → ❌ REJECT (403)
    │   Example: "Restaurant is currently closed"
    └─ Manual toggle ON? → Continue
    ↓
CHECK 2: Capacity
    ├─ At/over capacity (10+ orders)? → ❌ REJECT (503)
    │   Example: "Kitchen at capacity (10 active orders)"
    └─ Below capacity? → ✅ ACCEPT ORDER
```

**Both checks work correctly**:
- Order creation: ✅ Checks operating hours first
- Status display: ✅ Now also checks operating hours (FIXED)

## Manual Toggle Behavior

### What the Manual Toggle Does

The manual toggle in Kitchen Controls (`Restaurant Status`) allows staff to:
- **Override within hours**: Close temporarily even during operating hours
- **Emergency close**: Close immediately regardless of time

### What the Manual Toggle CANNOT Do

❌ **Cannot open outside operating hours**:
- Even if toggle is ON, restaurant shows as CLOSED if outside hours
- This prevents accepting orders when business should be closed

**Example**:
```
Thursday (marked as Closed)
Manual Toggle: ON
Result: Restaurant is CLOSED (operating hours override manual toggle)
```

---

## Priority Order

When determining effective status:

```
1. Operating Hours (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   ↓
2. Manual Toggle (SECOND PRIORITY)
   ↓
3. Capacity (Only affects open restaurants)
```

**Rationale**:
- Operating hours are **business rules** set by owner
- Manual toggle is **operational control** by staff
- Capacity is **automatic safety** to prevent overload

---

## Kitchen Display Implications

The **Kitchen Controls** manual toggle now has clearer behavior:

**When Operating Hours = Closed**:
- Toggle appears ON but restaurant is still CLOSED
- Banner should ideally show: "Cannot open - Outside operating hours"
- Staff can see they're in a closed period

**When Operating Hours = Open**:
- Toggle controls the status directly
- ON = Restaurant accepts orders
- OFF = Restaurant temporarily closed

---

## Cron Job Behavior

The cron job (`/api/cron/check-hours`) now respects manual toggles:

**Before** (Could cause issues):
```typescript
// Blindly sets status based on time
if (shouldBeOpen) {
  set is_open = true  // Could override manual close
}
```

**After** (Respects manual control):
```typescript
// Only auto-toggles based on operating hours
// Does not interfere with manual toggles within operating hours
if (shouldBeOpen && !manuallyOpen) {
  set is_open = true  // Auto-open at start of day
}
if (!shouldBeOpen && manuallyOpen) {
  set is_open = false  // Auto-close at end of day
}
```

**Important**: Cron still auto-closes at end of day even if manually opened

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] ✅ Thursday marked as "Closed" → Customer sees "Closed"
- [x] ✅ Manual toggle ON but outside hours → Customer sees "Closed"
- [x] ✅ Manual toggle OFF within hours → Customer sees "Closed"
- [x] ✅ Both ON and within hours → Customer sees "Open"
- [x] ✅ Banner shows reason for closure
- [x] ✅ Order creation respects operating hours
- [x] ✅ Status API returns effective status

---

## API Reference

### GET /api/restaurant/status

**Response**:
```typescript
{
  is_open: boolean;              // Effective status (hours AND manual)
  estimated_prep_time: number;
  message: string;               // User-friendly message
  closed_reason: string | null;  // Why closed (if closed)
  manual_override: boolean;      // Manual toggle state
  within_hours: boolean;         // Operating hours status
  hours: {
    today: string;               // "9:00 AM - 9:00 PM" or "Closed today"
    all: Record<string, string>; // All days
  };
  next_status_change: {
    action: 'open' | 'close';
    time: string;                // "9:00 AM"
    minutes: number;
  } | null;
}
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/api/restaurant/status/route.ts` - Calculate effective status
2. ✅ `types/database.ts` - Updated RestaurantStatusResponse interface
3. ✅ `components/menu/enhanced-banner.tsx` - Show closed reason

---

## Summary

### Problem
❌ Restaurant showed "Open" when Thursday was marked as "Closed"

### Solution
✅ Status now checks **BOTH** operating hours **AND** manual toggle

### Logic
```
Effective Status = Operating Hours ✅ AND Manual Toggle ✅
```

### Result
✅ Customer sees accurate status
✅ Banner shows why restaurant is closed
✅ No more confusion between toggle and hours
✅ Order creation and status display are consistent
