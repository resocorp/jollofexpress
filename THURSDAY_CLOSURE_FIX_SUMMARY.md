# Thursday Closure Issue - Fixed ✅

## The Problem (Reported: Oct 23, 2025, Thursday)

**What you saw**:
1. Admin Settings → Hours: Thursday marked as **"Closed"** ❌
2. Kitchen Controls: Manual toggle **"ON"** ✅
3. Customer Menu: Banner shows **"Open"** 🟢 ← **WRONG!**

**What should happen**: Customer should see **"Closed"** 🔴

---

## Root Cause

The customer-facing status API (`/api/restaurant/status`) was returning **ONLY** the manual toggle state, **ignoring** operating hours configuration.

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
return {
  is_open: settings.is_open  // Only checks manual toggle
}

// Result: Shows "Open" when toggle is ON, even on closed days
```

---

## The Fix

Updated status API to check **BOTH** conditions:

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT)
const manuallyOpen = settings.is_open;           // Manual toggle
const withinHours = shouldBeOpenNow();           // Operating hours
const effectivelyOpen = manuallyOpen && withinHours;  // Both required!

return {
  is_open: effectivelyOpen  // Must meet BOTH conditions
}
```

### Logic Rule

```
Restaurant is OPEN = Operating Hours ✅ AND Manual Toggle ✅
```

---

## What Changed

### 1. Status API (`app/api/restaurant/status/route.ts`)

**New behavior**:
- Checks if within operating hours
- Checks manual toggle state
- Returns "Open" only if BOTH are true
- Returns reason for closure

**New response fields**:
```json
{
  "is_open": false,               // Effective status
  "closed_reason": "Closed on Thursdays",  // ← NEW
  "manual_override": true,        // ← NEW: Shows toggle state
  "within_hours": false,          // ← NEW: Shows hours status
  ...
}
```

### 2. Customer Banner (`components/menu/enhanced-banner.tsx`)

**Now shows**:
- Clear closure reason
- Operating hours for today
- When restaurant will open (if applicable)

```
🔴 Closed

Currently closed - Closed today
Reason: Closed on Thursdays
Today's Hours: Closed today
```
