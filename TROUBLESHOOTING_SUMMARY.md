# üîç TROUBLESHOOTING SUMMARY - Order Creation Failure

## üìä ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What You Saw:
1. ‚ùå "Failed to create order" error in console
2. ‚ùå RLS policy violation (code 42501) in terminal
3. ‚ùå "Order Not Found" 404 page in browser
4. ‚ùå Paystack webhook 404 errors

### The 3 Root Causes:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **PORT MISMATCH (Most Critical)**
```
ngrok:     Forwarding to ‚Üí localhost:3000
Next.js:   Actually running ‚Üí localhost:3001
Result:    External requests hit NOTHING
```

**Why this happened:**
- Another process was using port 3000
- Next.js automatically switched to 3001
- ngrok didn't update to follow

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **STALE DEVELOPMENT SERVER**
```
Timeline:
1. Server started WITHOUT service role code
2. We added service client code
3. Server still running OLD code in memory
4. Environment variables from .env.local NOT reloaded
```

**Why this happened:**
- Next.js caches environment variables at startup
- Code changes were made while server was running
- Hot reload doesn't reload environment variables

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **POOR ERROR HANDLING**
```
Flow:
Order creation fails ‚Üí Code still redirects ‚Üí 404 page
```

**Why this happened:**
- No validation that order was created before redirect
- No user-friendly error messages
- Silent failure confusing for debugging

## üîß ALL FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Service Role Client (Code)
**File:** `lib/supabase/service.ts`
- ‚úÖ Created service client that bypasses RLS
- ‚úÖ Uses SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from environment
- ‚úÖ Only for trusted server-side operations

**File:** `app/api/orders/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Switched from regular client to service client
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging to trace env vars
- ‚úÖ Better error messages

### Fix #2: Hydration Error (UI)
**File:** `components/layout/header.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Added mounted state to prevent SSR/client mismatch
- ‚úÖ Cart badge only renders after mount
- ‚úÖ No more hydration warnings

### Fix #3: Better Error Handling (UX)
**File:** `components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Validates order creation succeeded before redirect
- ‚úÖ Shows specific error messages for different failures
- ‚úÖ Logs detailed info for debugging
- ‚úÖ Prevents 404 redirect on failed orders

### Fix #4: Validation Schema (Business Logic)
**Files:** `lib/validations.ts` + `app/api/orders/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Delivery address fields now conditional
- ‚úÖ Only required when order type is "delivery"
- ‚úÖ Carryout orders work without address

## ‚úÖ ACTION ITEMS FOR YOU

### Immediate Actions (Must Do):

1. **Stop ALL Servers**
   - Ctrl+C in terminal running Next.js
   - Ctrl+C in terminal running ngrok
   - OR use Task Manager ‚Üí End all Node.js processes

2. **Verify Environment File**
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Confirm this line exists:
     ```
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```
   - ‚úÖ YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS

3. **Clean Restart**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start Next.js
   npm run dev
   
   # Wait for: "Ready in XXXXms"
   # Note the port (should be 3000)
   ```

4. **Start ngrok on Correct Port**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 2: Start ngrok
   ngrok http 3000
   
   # Or if Next.js is on different port:
   ngrok http 3001
   ```

5. **Update Paystack Webhook**
   - Copy your NEW ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123xyz.ngrok-free.app`)
   - Go to Paystack Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Update Test Webhook URL to:
     ```
     https://YOUR-NEW-NGROK-URL/api/webhooks/paystack
     ```

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Test Scenario 1: Delivery Order
1. Go to `https://YOUR-NGROK-URL/menu`
2. Add items to cart
3. Click Cart ‚Üí Checkout
4. Select "Delivery"
5. Fill in:
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Phone: "08012345678"
   - City: "Awka"
   - Full Address: "No. 12 Test Street, opposite First Bank, near Test Junction, Awka" (20+ chars)
6. Click "Proceed to Payment"

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Terminal shows: `Environment check: { hasUrl: true, hasServiceKey: true, ... }`
- ‚úÖ Terminal shows: `Service client created successfully`
- ‚úÖ Terminal shows: `POST /api/orders 201`
- ‚úÖ Browser redirects to Paystack payment page
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

### Test Scenario 2: Carryout Order
1. Same as above but select "Carryout"
2. No address fields shown
3. Should still create order successfully

---

## üêõ IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Check These Debug Outputs:

**In Terminal (Server Logs):**
Look for my debug logs:
```javascript
Environment check: {
  hasUrl: true,           // Should be true
  hasServiceKey: true,    // MUST be true
  serviceKeyLength: 245   // Should be ~245 characters
}
Service client created successfully  // Must see this
```

**If `hasServiceKey: false`:**
- Environment variable not loading
- .env.local syntax error
- Hidden characters or line breaks in key
- Need to restart server (environment variables load at startup only)

**In Browser Console:**
```javascript
Order creation error: [error details]
```

**Common Error Types:**
- **"RLS" or "security"** ‚Üí Service key not working
- **"network" or "fetch"** ‚Üí Connection/port issue
- **"validation"** ‚Üí Form data invalid

---

## üéØ EXPECTED FINAL STATE

### ‚úÖ Success Checklist:
- [ ] Next.js running on port 3000 (or consistent port)
- [ ] ngrok forwarding to same port as Next.js
- [ ] Terminal shows service client created successfully
- [ ] No RLS errors (42501) in terminal
- [ ] Orders POST returns 201 status
- [ ] Paystack page loads with correct amount
- [ ] No hydration errors in browser console
- [ ] Cart badge shows correct count

### ‚úÖ Key Indicators Everything is Fixed:
1. **Environment loaded:** Debug log shows `hasServiceKey: true`
2. **Service client works:** No RLS errors
3. **Order created:** 201 response, not 500
4. **Payment initialized:** Redirects to Paystack
5. **Clean console:** No React hydration warnings

## üìö TECHNICAL SUMMARY

### What We Changed:
```
Before:
- Regular Supabase client (anon key)
- Subject to Row Level Security
- Can't create orders (no auth context)
- RLS blocks insertion ‚Üí 500 error

After:
- Service role client (service key)  
- Bypasses Row Level Security
- Trusted server-side operation
- Orders created successfully ‚Üí 201
```

### Why This is Secure:
1. Service key ONLY in `.env.local` (gitignored)
2. Only used in server-side API routes (not exposed to browser)
3. Validated on every request
4. Can't be accessed by client-side JavaScript

### Architecture:
```
Client (Browser)
    ‚Üì POST /api/orders
Server API Route
    ‚Üì createServiceClient()
Supabase (bypass RLS)
    ‚Üì Insert order
Database
    ‚Üì Return order + payment URL
Client (Browser)
    ‚Üì Redirect to Paystack
```

## üìû NEED MORE HELP?

If after following all steps the issue persists:

1. **Share terminal output** showing:
   - `Environment check:` log
   - Any error messages
   - POST /api/orders response

2. **Share browser console** showing:
   - Network tab ‚Üí /api/orders request/response
   - Console errors

3. **Confirm**:
   - [ ] Both servers restarted fresh
   - [ ] ngrok URL matches Next.js port
   - [ ] .env.local has service key
   - [ ] No syntax errors in .env.local

---

## ‚ú® SUMMARY

**Problem:** Order creation blocked by RLS + port mismatch + stale server
**Root Cause:** Environment not loaded + ngrok misconfigured + poor error handling  
**Solution:** Service role client + clean restart + port alignment + better UX
**Status:** Code fixed ‚úÖ | Environment exists ‚úÖ | Need clean restart ‚è≥
