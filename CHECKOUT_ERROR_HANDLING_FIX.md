# Checkout Error Handling - Fixed ✅

## Issue Reported

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Problem**: When trying to order outside operating hours, user received a console error instead of a user-friendly message

**Error Message**:
```
Error Type: Console ApiError
Error Message: Outside operating hours
at apiRequest (file://C:/Users/conwu/Downloads/winsurf projects/jollofexpress/.next/static/chunks/_8dd3d52f._.js:303:19)
```

---

## Root Cause

The order creation was correctly blocking orders outside operating hours, but the error was not being handled gracefully in the checkout form:

1. ✅ API correctly rejects order (403 error)
2. ❌ Error shown as console error, not user-friendly toast
3. ❌ No warning shown before user fills out checkout form

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Improved Error Handling (`components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx`)

**Before**:
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to create order');
}
```

**After** (Smart Error Detection):
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  const errorMessage = error.message || error.error;
  
  if (errorMessage.includes('Outside operating hours')) {
    // Restaurant closed due to hours
    toast.error('Restaurant Closed', {
      description: reason + '. Please check our operating hours.',
      duration: 6000,
    });
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('Kitchen at capacity')) {
    // Kitchen at max capacity
    toast.error('Kitchen at Capacity', {
      description: 'We're experiencing high demand. Try again in a few minutes.',
      duration: 6000,
    });
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('Restaurant is currently closed')) {
    // Manually closed
    toast.error('Restaurant Closed', {
      description: 'We are not accepting orders at this time.',
      duration: 6000,
    });
  } else {
    toast.error(errorMessage);
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Preventive Warning Banner

**New Alert at Top of Checkout**:
```tsx
{/* Restaurant Closed Warning */}
{!restaurantStatus?.is_open && (
  <Alert variant="destructive">
    <Clock className="h-5 w-5" />
    <AlertTitle>Restaurant Currently Closed</AlertTitle>
    <AlertDescription>
      <p>{restaurantStatus?.message}</p>
      <p>Reason: {restaurantStatus.closed_reason}</p>
      <p>Today's Hours: {restaurantStatus.hours.today}</p>
      <p>Opens at {restaurantStatus.next_status_change.time}</p>
    </AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
)}
```

**What it shows**:
- ⏰ Clear "Restaurant Currently Closed" heading
- 📋 Reason for closure (e.g., "Closed on Thursdays")
- 🕐 Today's operating hours
- ✅ When restaurant will open (if applicable)
- ⚠️ Warning that order will be rejected

---

## User Experience (Before vs After)

### Before Fix ❌

**Scenario**: User tries to order on Thursday (closed day)

1. User fills out entire checkout form
2. User clicks "Proceed to Payment"
3. Console error appears: "ApiError: Outside operating hours"
4. No clear message to user
5. Form remains filled out, user confused

### After Fix ✅

**Scenario**: User tries to order on Thursday (closed day)

**Step 1: Warning Shown Immediately**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⏰ Restaurant Currently Closed              │
│                                             │
│ Currently closed - Closed today             │
│ Reason: Closed on Thursdays                 │
│ Today's Hours: Closed today                 │
│                                             │
│ You can fill out the form, but your order  │
│ will be rejected when you try to place it. │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 2: If User Still Tries to Submit**
```
Toast Notification:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ❌ Restaurant Closed                        │
│                                             │
│ Closed on Thursdays. Please check our      │
│ operating hours and try again later.        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
(Shows for 6 seconds)
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. ✅ `components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx`
   - Added `useRestaurantStatus()` hook
   - Added preventive warning banner
   - Enhanced error handling with specific messages

### New Imports

```typescript
import { Clock } from 'lucide-react';
import { useRestaurantStatus } from '@/hooks/use-settings';
import { AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';
```

### Error Detection Logic

```typescript
// Check error message for specific patterns
if (errorMessage.includes('Outside operating hours'))
if (errorMessage.includes('Kitchen at capacity'))
if (errorMessage.includes('Restaurant is currently closed'))
```

maxOrders: 10
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Order on Closed Day (Thursday)

**Setup**:
- Operating hours: Thursday = Closed
- Navigate to checkout

**Expected**:
1. ✅ Red warning banner shows immediately
2. ✅ Banner shows: "Closed on Thursdays"
3. ✅ Banner shows: "Today's Hours: Closed today"
4. ✅ If user submits: Toast shows "Restaurant Closed"
5. ✅ Toast duration: 6 seconds

---

### Test 2: Order Outside Hours

**Setup**:
- Operating hours: 9 AM - 9 PM
- Current time: 8 AM (before opening)
- Navigate to checkout

**Expected**:
1. ✅ Red warning banner shows
2. ✅ Banner shows: "Opens at 9:00 AM"
3. ✅ If user submits: Toast shows "Restaurant Closed"
4. ✅ Toast includes: "Please check our operating hours"

---

### Test 3: Order at Capacity

**Setup**:
- Restaurant open
- 10 active orders in kitchen
- Navigate to checkout

**Expected**:
1. ❌ No warning banner (restaurant is technically open)
2. ✅ User fills form and submits
3. ✅ Toast shows: "Kitchen at Capacity"
4. ✅ Toast shows: "(10/10 orders)"

---

### Test 4: Manually Closed

**Setup**:
- Within operating hours
- Admin manually closed restaurant
- Navigate to checkout

**Expected**:
1. ✅ Red warning banner shows
2. ✅ Banner shows: "Manually closed by staff"
3. ✅ If user submits: Toast shows "Restaurant Closed"

---

## Banner Display Logic

```typescript
// Only show if restaurant is effectively closed
{!restaurantStatus?.is_open && (
  <Alert variant="destructive">
    // Warning content
  </Alert>
)}
```

**When banner appears**:
- ✅ Outside operating hours (closed day or time)
- ✅ Manually closed by staff
- ✅ Both conditions (outside hours AND manually closed)

**When banner does NOT appear**:
- ✅ Within operating hours AND manually open
- ❌ At capacity (restaurant still "open", just at max orders)

---

## Toast Configuration

```typescript
toast.error('Title', {
  description: 'Detailed message',
  duration: 6000,  // 6 seconds
});
```

**Why 6 seconds?**
- Default toast: 3-4 seconds
- Error messages need more time to read
- User needs time to understand next steps

---

## API Response Structure

### Error Response from `/api/orders`

```json
{
  "error": "Outside operating hours",
  "message": "Closed on Thursdays",
  "details": {
    "reason": "Closed on Thursdays"
  }
}
```

### Restaurant Status from `/api/restaurant/status`

```json
{
  "is_open": false,
  "message": "Currently closed - Closed today",
  "closed_reason": "Closed on Thursdays",
  "hours": {
    "today": "Closed today"
  },
  "next_status_change": {
    "action": "open",
    "time": "9:00 AM",
    "minutes": 720
  }
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

1. **Disable Submit Button**
   ```typescript
   disabled={isSubmitting || !restaurantStatus?.is_open}
   ```
   Pros: Prevents submission
   Cons: User can't see error details

2. **Countdown Timer**
   ```typescript
   Opens in: 2 hours 15 minutes
   ```
   Show real-time countdown to opening

3. **Schedule Order for Later**
   ```
   Restaurant opens at 9:00 AM
   [Schedule Order for 9:00 AM]
   ```
   Allow pre-ordering for when restaurant opens

4. **Email Notification**
   ```
   Get notified when we open
   [Enter Email]
   ```

5. **Redirect to Menu**
   ```typescript
   if (!restaurantStatus?.is_open) {
     router.push('/menu?closed=true');
   }
   ```
   Prevent accessing checkout when closed
