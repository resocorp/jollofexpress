# Dashboard Statistics Implementation

## Overview
Implemented real-time dashboard statistics and recent orders display for the JollofExpress admin dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dashboard API Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/admin/dashboard/route.ts`

This new API endpoint calculates and returns:
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all successful orders for the current month
- **Total Orders**: Count of successful orders for the current month
- **Average Order Value**: Revenue divided by order count
- **Average Prep Time**: Average estimated preparation time for orders
- **Percentage Changes**: Comparison with the previous month for all metrics
- **Recent Orders**: Last 10 orders with details

**Key Features**:
- Only counts orders with `payment_status = 'success'`
- Compares current month vs previous month for trend analysis
- Returns recent orders for display

### 2. Updated Dashboard Page
**File**: `app/admin/page.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- Integrated React Query for data fetching with 30-second auto-refresh
- Added loading states with skeleton placeholders
- Added error handling with user-friendly messages
- Dynamic stats display with color-coded percentage changes:
  - Green for positive changes (revenue, orders, avg order value)
  - Red for negative changes
  - Green for reduced prep time (negative change = improvement)
- Recent orders section showing:
  - Order number and status badges
  - Payment status badges
  - Customer name
  - Order total in Naira (₦)
  - Date and time

### 3. Statistics Calculation Logic

#### Total Revenue
- Sums `total` field from all successful orders in current month
- Compares with previous month to show percentage change

#### Total Orders
- Counts all orders with `payment_status = 'success'` in current month
- Shows growth/decline from previous month

#### Average Order Value
- Calculated as: `Total Revenue / Total Orders`
- Shows if average spending per customer is increasing/decreasing

#### Average Prep Time
- Averages `estimated_prep_time` from orders that have this field set
- Lower is better (negative change shows as green)

## Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/admin
2. **Expected Results**:
   - Stats cards should show real numbers from your orders
   - Revenue should match total from paid orders
   - Recent orders section should display last 10 orders
   - Percentage changes show month-over-month trends
3. **Auto-refresh**: Dashboard data refreshes every 30 seconds automatically

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "totalRevenue": {
      "value": 400000,
      "change": 25.5
    },
    "totalOrders": {
      "value": 150,
      "change": 15.3
    },
    "avgOrderValue": {
      "value": 2666.67,
      "change": 8.8
    },
    "avgPrepTime": {
      "value": 28,
      "change": -6.7
    }
  },
  "recentOrders": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "order_number": "ORD-20251021-0001",
      "customer_name": "John Doe",
      "total": 5000,
      "status": "completed",
      "payment_status": "success",
      "created_at": "2025-10-21T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- The dashboard only counts orders with successful payments
- All monetary values are formatted in Nigerian Naira (₦)
- Percentage changes are calculated against the previous calendar month
- Orders without `estimated_prep_time` are excluded from prep time averages
- The recent orders display handles empty states gracefully

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add date range filter for custom period analysis
2. Add more detailed analytics (revenue by day, popular items, etc.)
3. Add export functionality for reports
4. Add real-time notifications for new orders
5. Add charts/graphs for visual data representation
