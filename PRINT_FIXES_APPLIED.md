# Print Issues Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Reprint Button Not Working ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Clicking reprint button doesn't trigger printing

**Root Cause:** Print window may be blocked by popup blocker or AutoPrintHandler not processing

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added better logging to track print job flow
2. Added duplicate job prevention
3. Only render receipt when actively processing (prevents multiple instances)
4. Added console logs to help debug

**How to verify:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click Reprint button
3. Look for console messages:
   ```
   üñ®Ô∏è New print job received: {...}
   ‚úÖ Adding job to queue: <job-id>
   üñ®Ô∏è Processing print job: <job-id>
   üñ®Ô∏è Opening print window for: ORD-XXX
   ```
4. Print dialog should appear within 2-5 seconds

### Issue 2: Printing 3 Pages Instead of 1 ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Receipt prints 3 pages/sheets instead of single receipt

**Root Cause:** 
- Problematic `@media print` styles with `body * { visibility: hidden; }`
- Receipt component styles interfering when copied to print window
- Multiple receipt instances being rendered

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Removed problematic `visibility: hidden` styles from PrintReceipt component
2. Improved print window HTML generation:
   - Extract and separate receipt styles
   - Copy styles to print window <head>
   - Remove conflicting nested styles
   - Simplified @media print rules
3. Added condition to only render receipt when actively processing
4. Better DOM cloning and style extraction

**Result:** Should now print only 1 page with the receipt

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Verify Single Page Print

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open kitchen display: `http://localhost:3000/kitchen`
3. Click printer icon on an order
4. **Check print preview:**
   - Should show "1 sheet of paper" (not 3)
   - Should show only 1 receipt
   - Receipt should be properly formatted

### Test 2: Verify Reprint Works

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click Reprint button in order details dialog
3. **Expected console output:**
   ```
   üñ®Ô∏è New print job received: {...}
   ‚úÖ Adding job to queue: <uuid>
   üñ®Ô∏è Processing print job: <uuid>
   üñ®Ô∏è Opening print window for: ORD-20251021-XXXX
   ‚úì Print job <uuid> marked as printed
   ```
4. Print dialog appears
5. Toast notification: "Printed: Order ORD-XXX"

### Test 3: Verify No Duplicates

1. Click Reprint multiple times quickly
2. **Expected:**
   - Only one print job added
   - Console shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate print job ignored" for subsequent clicks
   - Only one print dialog appears

### Test 4: Verify Automatic Print After Payment

1. Create new order and complete payment
2. **Expected:**
   - Print job added to queue automatically
   - Print dialog appears within 5 seconds
   - Receipt prints correctly
   - Only 1 page/sheet

## What Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **`components/print/auto-print-handler.tsx`**
   - Added duplicate job prevention
   - Improved print window HTML generation
   - Better style extraction and copying
   - Added extensive logging
   - Only render receipt when processing

2. **`components/print/print-receipt.tsx`**
   - Removed problematic `@media print` styles
   - Simplified print CSS
   - Removed `visibility: hidden` approach

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Reprint Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Check if subscription is active: "Print queue subscription status: {status: 'SUBSCRIBED'}"

2. **Check pop-up blocker**
   - Browser may be blocking print window
   - Allow pop-ups for localhost

3. **Check Supabase connection**
   - Verify AutoPrintHandler loaded (debug indicator bottom-left)
   - Check network tab for failed API calls

4. **Check print_queue table**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM print_queue ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - Verify jobs are being inserted
   - Check status and error_message columns

### If Still Printing Multiple Pages:

1. **Check print preview**
   - How many pages shown in preview?
   - Are they duplicates or continuation?

2. **Check printer settings**
   - Copies set to 1 (not 3)
   - Not printing multiple ranges

3. **Check browser console**
   - Look for: "üñ®Ô∏è Processing print job" - should only appear once
   - If appears 3 times = multiple AutoPrintHandler instances

4. **Ensure only one kitchen display tab open**
   - Close other tabs with kitchen display
   - Each tab creates a new AutoPrintHandler

## Console Logging Reference

When working correctly, you should see:

### On Page Load:
```
üñ®Ô∏è Print handler: Subscribing to print_queue changes
Print queue subscription status: {status: 'SUBSCRIBED'}
```

### When Clicking Reprint:
```
üñ®Ô∏è New print job received: {id: "...", order_id: "...", ...}
‚úÖ Adding job to queue: <uuid>
üñ®Ô∏è Processing print job: <uuid>
üñ®Ô∏è Opening print window for: ORD-20251021-XXXX
‚úì Print job <uuid> marked as printed
```

### When Payment Succeeds:
```
üñ®Ô∏è New print job received: {id: "...", order_id: "...", ...}
‚úÖ Adding job to queue: <uuid>
üñ®Ô∏è Processing print job: <uuid>
üñ®Ô∏è Opening print window for: ORD-20251021-XXXX
‚úì Print job <uuid> marked as printed
```

### On Duplicate Job:
```
üñ®Ô∏è New print job received: {id: "...", ...}
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate print job ignored: <uuid>
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test reprint button
2. ‚úÖ Verify only 1 page prints
3. ‚úÖ Test automatic print after payment
4. ‚úÖ Monitor console for any errors
5. ‚úÖ Check print_queue table for failed jobs

If issues persist, provide:
- Browser console output (copy/paste)
- Screenshot of print preview
- print_queue table data for failing job
