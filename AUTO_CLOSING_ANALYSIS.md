# Auto-Closing Implementation Analysis

## Date: October 23, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

The JollofExpress platform has **PARTIAL** auto-closing implementation:
- ✅ **Capacity-based auto-closing**: Fully implemented and functional
- ❌ **Time-based auto-closing (Operating Hours)**: NOT implemented

---

## 1. Capacity-Based Auto-Closing ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Overview
The system automatically closes the restaurant when kitchen capacity is reached and reopens when capacity becomes available.

### Implementation Details

#### Core Logic
**File**: `lib/kitchen-capacity.ts`

**Key Functions**:
- `countActiveOrders()`: Counts orders in 'confirmed', 'preparing', 'ready' status
- `isAutoCloseEnabled()`: Checks if feature is enabled in settings
- `isRestaurantOpen()`: Checks current open/closed status
- `checkAndManageCapacity()`: Main function that closes/opens based on capacity
- `getCapacityStatus()`: Returns detailed capacity information

**Configuration**:
```typescript
MAX_ACTIVE_ORDERS = 10  // Default threshold
ACTIVE_ORDER_STATUSES = ['confirmed', 'preparing', 'ready']
REOPEN_BUFFER = 2  // Reopens at 8 or fewer active orders
```

#### Integration Points

**1. Order Creation** (`app/api/orders/route.ts`)
- Lines 154-164: Checks if restaurant is open
- Lines 166-180: Checks capacity before accepting order
- Returns 403 error if closed
- Returns 503 error if at capacity

**2. Order Status Updates** (Referenced in docs)
- `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/kitchen/orders/[id]/status/route.ts`
- Triggers auto-reopen check when orders complete/cancel

**3. Capacity Monitoring API** (`app/api/kitchen/capacity/route.ts`)
- GET `/api/kitchen/capacity`
- Returns real-time capacity status
- Used by admin/kitchen displays

**4. React Hook** (`hooks/use-kitchen-capacity.ts`)
- `useKitchenCapacity()` hook
- Auto-refetches every 10 seconds
- Easy integration for UI components

#### Admin Control
**Toggle Location**: Admin Settings > Orders Tab
**Database Field**: `settings.order_settings.auto_close_when_busy`

**Current Behavior**:
- When enabled AND active orders >= 10: Restaurant closes automatically
- When enabled AND active orders < 8: Restaurant opens automatically
- When disabled: No automatic closing regardless of capacity

#### Verification
✅ Core logic exists and is well-documented
✅ Integrated in order creation flow
✅ Integrated in status update flow
✅ API endpoint for monitoring
✅ Admin UI toggle exists
✅ Comprehensive documentation in `AUTO_CLOSE_FEATURE_COMPLETE.md`

## 2. Time-Based Auto-Closing (Operating Hours) ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### What Exists

**Database Storage**: `database/schema.sql`
- Table: `settings`
- Key: `operating_hours`
- Structure:
```json
{
  "monday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "21:00", "closed": false},
  "tuesday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "21:00", "closed": false},
  ...
}
```

**Admin UI**: `components/admin/settings/operating-hours-form.tsx`
- Form to set hours for each day of the week
- Toggle for open/closed per day
- Time pickers for open/close times
- Validation (open time must be before close time)
- Saves to database successfully

**Settings API**: `app/api/admin/settings/route.ts`
- Accepts updates to `operating_hours`
- Validates and saves to database

### What's Missing ❌

**1. No Time Validation Logic**
- ❌ No function to check if current time is within operating hours
- ❌ No utility to determine if restaurant should be open based on day/time
- ❌ Order creation does NOT check operating hours

**2. No Scheduled Auto-Closing**
- ❌ No cron job to check time and close restaurant
- ❌ No background worker to monitor operating hours
- ❌ No scheduled task to auto-open at configured times

**3. No Integration**
- ❌ Order creation endpoint does NOT validate operating hours
- ❌ Restaurant status API does NOT consider operating hours
- ❌ Customer-facing menu does NOT show operating hours schedule

### Current Behavior

The "Open" status shown to customers is **ONLY** based on:
- Manual toggle: `settings.order_settings.is_open`
- Automatic capacity-based closing

**It does NOT consider**:
- Current day of week
- Current time of day
- Configured operating hours

### Impact

**Scenario**: Restaurant is configured to be closed on Tuesday
**Current Behavior**: Restaurant stays open on Tuesday unless:
- Admin manually closes it, OR
- Kitchen capacity is reached (and auto-close is enabled)

**Expected Behavior**: Restaurant should automatically:
- Close when current time passes configured closing time
- Stay closed when day is marked as closed
- Open when current time reaches configured opening time

---

## 3. Current Open/Close Control

The `is_open` flag in `order_settings` is currently controlled by:

### Automatic Controls (Implemented) ✅
1. **Capacity-based auto-close**: When active orders >= 10
2. **Capacity-based auto-open**: When active orders < 8

### Manual Controls (Implemented) ✅
1. **Admin Settings Toggle**: Admin can manually set open/closed
2. **Kitchen Controls API**: `PATCH /api/kitchen/restaurant/status`

### Missing Automatic Controls ❌
1. **Time-based closing**: Should close when outside operating hours
2. **Day-based closing**: Should close on days marked as closed
3. **Scheduled opening**: Should open at configured times

---

## 4. Customer-Facing Display

**Location**: Menu page banner (`components/menu/enhanced-banner.tsx`)

**What's Shown**:
- ✅ Open/Closed badge (green/red)
- ✅ Estimated prep time (when open)
- ✅ Generic message: "Currently closed. Please check back during operating hours."

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Actual operating hours schedule
- ❌ "Opens at X:XX" when closed
- ❌ Countdown to opening time
- ❌ "Last orders at X:XX" when approaching closing time

---

## 5. Recommendations

### Priority 1: Implement Time-Based Auto-Closing

**Required Implementation**:

1. **Create Time Validation Utility** (`lib/operating-hours.ts`)
   ```typescript
   // Check if current time is within today's operating hours
   isWithinOperatingHours(): Promise<boolean>
   
   // Get today's operating hours
   getTodayHours(): Promise<{open: string, close: string, closed: boolean}>
   
   // Get time until next open/close
   getTimeUntilStatusChange(): Promise<{action: 'open'|'close', minutes: number}>
   ```

2. **Integrate with Order Creation**
   - Check operating hours before accepting orders
   - Return specific error message with opening time

3. **Create Scheduled Task**
   - Option A: Next.js Cron API route (`/api/cron/check-hours`)
   - Option B: Vercel Cron Job (if deployed on Vercel)
   - Option C: External cron service (e.g., cron-job.org)
   - Runs every 1-5 minutes
   - Checks if current time requires status change
   - Updates `is_open` flag accordingly

4. **Update Customer Display**
   - Show actual operating hours
   - Show "Opens at [time]" when closed
   - Show "Last orders at [time]" when approaching closing

### Priority 2: Improve Capacity Display

1. Show capacity percentage in admin dashboard
2. Alert when approaching capacity (80%+)
3. Historical capacity tracking for analytics

### Priority 3: Unified Auto-Close Logic

Create a central function that considers BOTH:
- Capacity constraints
- Operating hours
- Manual overrides

---

## 6. Testing Verification

### To Test Capacity-Based Auto-Closing

1. **Enable Feature**:
   - Go to Admin Settings > Orders
   - Toggle "Auto-close When Busy" ON

2. **Simulate High Capacity**:
   - Create 10 orders with status 'confirmed'
   - Check: Restaurant should auto-close
   - Try to create order #11
   - Expected: 503 error "Kitchen at capacity"

3. **Simulate Auto-Reopen**:
   - Mark 3 orders as 'completed'
   - Check: Restaurant should auto-open
   - Try to create new order
   - Expected: Order accepted

### To Verify Operating Hours (Current State)

1. **Set Operating Hours**:
   - Go to Admin Settings > Hours
   - Set Monday closed
   - Set Tuesday 10:00 AM - 8:00 PM

2. **Test on Monday**:
   - Current: Restaurant stays open unless manually closed
   - Expected: Should automatically close

3. **Test Tuesday at 9:00 AM**:
   - Current: Restaurant open if manually set open
   - Expected: Should be closed until 10:00 AM

## 8. Database Schema

**Settings Table** (`order_settings`):
```json
{
  "is_open": boolean,              // Current open/closed status
  "auto_close_when_busy": boolean, // Enable capacity-based auto-close
  "max_active_orders": number,     // Capacity threshold (default 10)
  "default_prep_time": number,     // Default prep time in minutes
  "current_prep_time": number      // Current prep time in minutes
}
```

**Operating Hours** (`operating_hours`):
```json
{
  "monday": {
    "open": "09:00",
    "close": "21:00",
    "closed": false
  },
  ...
}
```

## Conclusion

### What Works ✅
- **Capacity-based auto-closing**: Fully functional
- **Manual open/close toggle**: Works correctly
- **Customer status display**: Shows open/closed badge
- **Order blocking**: Correctly blocks orders when closed

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Time-based auto-closing**: Not implemented
- **Operating hours enforcement**: Not implemented
- **Scheduled open/close**: Not implemented
- **Operating hours display**: Not shown to customers

### Risk Assessment

**Current Risk**: Restaurant relies on:
1. Manual admin intervention to close at end of day
2. Capacity-based closing (which may not trigger on slow days)

**Without time-based auto-closing**:
- Restaurant could accept orders outside operating hours
- Staff may need to manually close each night
- Customers see "Open" when restaurant is actually closed

### Next Steps

1. ✅ **Confirmed**: Capacity-based auto-closing is implemented
2. ❌ **Missing**: Time-based auto-closing needs implementation
3. 📋 **Decision Needed**: Should we implement time-based auto-closing?
