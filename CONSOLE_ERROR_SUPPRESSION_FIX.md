# Console Error Suppression - Fixed ✅

## Issue

Even though errors were being handled with user-friendly toast messages, they were still appearing in the browser console as:

```
Console ApiError
Outside operating hours
  at apiRequest ...
```

This made it look like something was broken, even though it was expected behavior.

---

## Root Cause

The console errors were being logged at **multiple levels**:

1. ❌ `lib/api-client.ts` - No explicit logging, but error was thrown
2. ❌ `hooks/use-orders.ts` - No error suppression in mutation
3. ❌ `components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx` - Explicit `console.error()` call

Additionally, React Query and Next.js dev mode may log errors by default.

---

## Solution

Suppressed console logging for **expected errors** at all three levels:

### 1. API Client (`lib/api-client.ts`)

**Added logic to not log 403/503 errors**:

```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  // Don't log expected errors (403 for closed restaurant, 503 for capacity)
  const isExpectedError = response.status === 403 || response.status === 503;
  
  const apiError = new ApiError(
    data.error || data.message || 'An error occurred',
    response.status,
    data
  );
  
  // Only log unexpected errors to console
  if (!isExpectedError) {
    console.error('API Error:', {
      status: response.status,
      message: apiError.message,
      endpoint,
    });
  }
  
  throw apiError;
}
```

**What this does**:
- ✅ Still throws the error (so it can be caught and handled)
- ✅ Doesn't log 403 (restaurant closed) or 503 (capacity) to console
- ✅ Still logs other errors (500, 400, etc.) for debugging

---

### 2. React Query Hook (`hooks/use-orders.ts`)

**Added onError handler to suppress expected errors**:

```typescript
export function useCreateOrder() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data: Partial<Order> & { items: any[] }) =>
      post<{ order: Order; payment_url: string }>('/api/orders', data),
    
    // Don't log expected errors to console (403/503 are handled in UI)
    onError: (error: any) => {
      const isExpectedError = 
        error.statusCode === 403 || // Restaurant closed / outside hours
        error.statusCode === 503;   // Kitchen at capacity
      
      if (!isExpectedError) {
        console.error('Unexpected order creation error:', error);
      }
    },
  });
}
```

**What this does**:
- ✅ Prevents React Query from logging 403/503 errors
- ✅ Still logs unexpected errors (network, 500, etc.)
- ✅ Error still propagates to catch block for toast display

---

### 3. Checkout Form (`components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx`)

**Removed console.error for expected errors**:

```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
  const errorMessage = error.message || error.error || 'Failed to create order';
  
  if (errorMessage.includes('Outside operating hours')) {
    // Restaurant is closed - show toast (no console log)
    toast.error('Restaurant Closed', { ... });
    
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('Kitchen at capacity')) {
    // Kitchen at capacity - show toast (no console log)
    toast.error('Kitchen at Capacity', { ... });
    
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('Restaurant is currently closed')) {
    // Manually closed - show toast (no console log)
    toast.error('Restaurant Closed', { ... });
    
  } else {
    // Unexpected error - log to console for debugging
    console.error('Order creation error:', error);
    toast.error(errorMessage);
  }
}
```

**What this does**:
- ✅ Shows user-friendly toast for expected errors
- ✅ No console.error for expected errors
- ✅ Still logs unexpected errors for debugging

---

## Error Classification

### Expected Errors (Not Logged)

These are **business logic** errors that users will encounter during normal operation:

| Status | Error | User Sees | Console | Why |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|-----|
| 403 | Outside operating hours | Toast: "Restaurant Closed" | ❌ Silent | Normal - restaurant is closed |
| 403 | Restaurant manually closed | Toast: "Restaurant Closed" | ❌ Silent | Normal - staff closed it |
| 503 | Kitchen at capacity | Toast: "Kitchen at Capacity" | ❌ Silent | Normal - too many orders |

### Unexpected Errors (Still Logged)

These are **real errors** that need developer attention:

| Status | Error | User Sees | Console | Why |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|-----|
| 400 | Bad request | Toast: Error message | ✅ Logged | Need to fix validation |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Toast: Error message | ✅ Logged | Auth issue |
| 500 | Server error | Toast: Error message | ✅ Logged | Backend bug |
| 0 | Network error | Toast: "Network error" | ✅ Logged | Connection issue |

## Testing

### Test 1: Order Outside Hours (Thursday - Closed)

**Before Fix**:
```
Browser Console:
❌ Console ApiError
❌ Outside operating hours
❌   at apiRequest (file:///.../api-client.ts:303)
```

**After Fix**:
```
Browser Console:
✅ (Empty - no error logged)

User Sees:
✅ Toast: "Restaurant Closed - Closed on Thursdays"
```

---

### Test 2: Kitchen at Capacity (10 orders)

**Before Fix**:
```
Browser Console:
❌ Console ApiError
❌ Kitchen at capacity
❌   at apiRequest ...
```

**After Fix**:
```
Browser Console:
✅ (Empty - no error logged)

User Sees:
✅ Toast: "Kitchen at Capacity (10/10 orders)"
```

---

### Test 3: Real Error (500 server error)

**Before Fix**:
```
Browser Console:
❌ Console ApiError
❌ Internal server error
```

**After Fix**:
```
Browser Console:
✅ API Error: {
     status: 500,
     message: "Internal server error",
     endpoint: "/api/orders"
   }

User Sees:
✅ Toast: "Internal server error"
```

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode (npm run dev)

**Behavior**:
- ✅ Expected errors (403/503): Silent in console
- ✅ Unexpected errors: Logged to console
- ⚠️ Next.js may still show some errors in overlay (can be dismissed)

**Why some errors still appear**:
- Next.js dev mode has aggressive error reporting
- Browser dev tools may catch re-thrown errors
- This is **development-only** behavior

### Production Mode (npm run build && npm start)

**Behavior**:
- ✅ Expected errors: Completely silent
- ✅ Unexpected errors: Logged to console
- ✅ No Next.js error overlay
- ✅ Clean user experience

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `lib/api-client.ts` - Suppress 403/503 error logging
2. ✅ `hooks/use-orders.ts` - Add onError handler to mutation
3. ✅ `components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx` - Remove console.error for expected errors

---

## User Experience

### Before Fix ❌

1. User tries to order on Thursday (closed)
2. **Toast shows**: "Restaurant Closed"
3. **Console shows**: "ApiError: Outside operating hours" ❌
4. **Looks broken** even though it works correctly

### After Fix ✅

1. User tries to order on Thursday (closed)
2. **Toast shows**: "Restaurant Closed"
3. **Console shows**: (nothing) ✅
4. **Looks professional** - error is properly handled

---

## Important Notes

1. **Errors are NOT being hidden** - they're still being handled and shown to users
2. **Debugging is NOT affected** - unexpected errors are still logged
3. **Production behavior is clean** - no console spam
4. **Development may still show some errors** - this is Next.js dev mode being helpful

---

## If You Still See Console Errors

### In Development (npm run dev)

**Next.js Error Overlay**:
- You might see a red overlay with error details
- This is **development-only** and won't appear in production
- Click the X to dismiss it
- The error is still properly handled underneath

**Browser Dev Tools**:
- Modern browsers may log errors even when caught
- Check if the error is in red (uncaught) or gray (caught)
- Caught errors are fine - they're being handled

### To Completely Disable (Dev Only)

Add to `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivity: false,
    appIsrStatus: false,
  },
  // Suppress some error logging in dev
  logging: {
    fetches: {
      fullUrl: false,
    },
  },
};
```
